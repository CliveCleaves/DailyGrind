            <p>Charline Cleaver graduated from Queens University with a Bachelor of Arts in Drama and Music as well as a Bachelor of Education in the same fields. She worked at a coffee shop for a few years following the completion of her degree while she pursued her dream of working in the film and television industry. She received a request to work at a Model and Talent Agency and was excited by the prospect! She loved everyone at the coffee shop and found the transition difficult.  Over the course of the year, she started to see that she was not a match for working at a secular agency and left, trusting that God had a plan for her life.  She fell into working as a background actor in Toronto. It was exciting for her to be on the sets of network television shows and feature films giving her insight into the filming process. She takes every opportunity to learn as much as she can while on set. In her downtime she loves to create and write. Charline holds tightly to her values and faith in Jesus. The journey has not been easy for her. Being a christian in an industry that often seems so counter to God has presented it’s challenges. She’s had to figure out how to maneuver the business and how to have the courage to say no, while trying to remain a positive witness. It has created a longing for roles that people who love the Lord can be confident portraying. Messages that will help and not hinder. The more she has worked, the more she has seen the need for wholesome, family friendly entertainment. All the experiences and hardships have led to the stories on the pages. Charline loves to pull from real life experiences and from people who have inspired her through the years. Her dream is to someday work on a creative team bringing to life stories that inspire the human heart.</p>
